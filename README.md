# BIP-Segmentation!
The aim of this project is to identify trees in saatellite images using segmentation technique. Gottingen Aerial dataset is used for training the model which has only 38 labeled images. We split the dataset in a 80:20 ratio which gives 30 images for training and 8 images for testing.


A sample result of the DeepLabV3 model based on Resnet152 encoder pretrained on Imagenet is displayed below:
